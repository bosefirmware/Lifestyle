# 27.145 MHz BOSE Lifestyle RC-9 (Europe) with Arduino

 * Best option is to buy a garage door opener sender and try to attach it to an Arudino to replay the BOSE signals?
 * Can I see and decode the signal in using a RTL SDR? -> YES, using Gqrx-x86_64.AppImage
 * sudo rmmod r820t rtl2832 dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2830 dvb_usb_rtl28xxu dvb_usb_v2 dvb_core then CubicSDR-0.2.0-x86_64.AppImage
 * How can I use Arduino to generate these signals?

* Here someone suggests https://discuss.ninjablocks.com/t/rtl-sdr-and-usb-receivers-for-433mhz-devices-and-lots-of-other-frequencies/1426/8 "I was wondering if this PiFm 'hack' http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter38 , an rtl-sdr and a 20 cm piece of wire would help to provide a generic RC tranciever unit for a ninjablock. At present it seems that this is limited 1Mhz up to 250Mhz - so my Bose is in"

## FCC

So far I did not find RC-9 in the FCC database but other (possibly similar?) devices.

### Remote 1: AV35
 
Transceiver Test Report for FCC ID: A94402455 says:

The 27.145 MHz TX in the console sends out a data packet with a duty cycle of 32.5% maximum.  The transmit sequence has the following segments: 

*  2.6 ms of low level carrier only (-16 dBc) 
*  5.09 ms of full power carrier 
*  31 characters of transmitted information – maximum length is 52 ms. Duty cycle is 50% during those 52 ms

### Remote 2: AV18 (BOSE LIFESTYLE® 38 and 48)

Pulsed (On-off keying, OOK). According to Wikipedia, On-off keying (OOK) denotes the simplest form of amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulation that represents digital data at the presence or absence of a carrier wave.

Here is another signal from another transmitter that looks similar but is different:

### Remote 3:  RC35S2-27 remote control for the second zone of Bose V25/V35 Lifestyle systems

https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=1274121

Signal again looks similar. 4 iterations

## Generating these signals with Arudino

Might be possible with a AD9850 module

Or with a Si4012. The Si4012 is a fully integrated FSK/OOK crystal-less CMOS high-data rate RF transmitter designed for the sub-GHz ISM band.

Analyzing the signal timing may be possible with Audacity.

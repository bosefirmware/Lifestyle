# 27.145 MHz BOSE Lifestyle RC-9 (Europe) with Arduino

 * Best option is to buy a garage door opener sender and try to attach it to an Arudino to replay the BOSE signals?
 * Can I see and decode the signal in using a RTL SDR? -> YES, using Gqrx-x86_64.AppImage
 * sudo rmmod r820t rtl2832 dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2830 dvb_usb_rtl28xxu dvb_usb_v2 dvb_core then CubicSDR-0.2.0-x86_64.AppImage
 * How can I use Arduino to generate these signals?

* Here someone suggests https://discuss.ninjablocks.com/t/rtl-sdr-and-usb-receivers-for-433mhz-devices-and-lots-of-other-frequencies/1426/8 "I was wondering if this PiFm 'hack' http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter38 , an rtl-sdr and a 20 cm piece of wire would help to provide a generic RC tranciever unit for a ninjablock. At present it seems that this is limited 1Mhz up to 250Mhz - so my Bose is in"
